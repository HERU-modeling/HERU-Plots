# HERU-Plots

[`HERU-Plots`](https://github.com/HERU-modeling/HERU-Plots) provides example code for a number of different and unique plots that have been included in prior HERU publications. The goal of this repository is to have a single location for anyone to download reference code.

# Instructions

Please feel free to upload your own code for plots, keeping in mind the points below:

1.  Each plot should be in its own labelled folder. See: [`Tornado Plot`](https://github.com/HERU-modeling/HERU-Plots/tree/main/Tornado%20Plot)

2.  Include a README.md file in each folder with a brief description of the plot and the code.

3.  Include an .R file with the code for the plot, as well as any necessary data files. Everything to create plots should be self-contained in the folder.

4.  Include a .png file of the plot.

5.  Code and data should be organized such that the plot can be reproduced by running the .R file. See: [tornado_plot_example.R](https://github.com/HERU-modeling/HERU-Plots/tree/main/Tornado%20Plot/tornado_plot_example.R)
