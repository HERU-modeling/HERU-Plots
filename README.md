# HERU-Plots

[`HERU-Plots`](https://github.com/HERU-modeling/HERU-Plots) provides a single location for accessing example code from a number of unique plots that have been included in prior publications. This repository is intended to be a living resource, and HERU team members are encouraged to contribute their own code for plots that they have created.

# Instructions

To use these templates, you can a.) clone the repository (if you have a GitHub account); or b.) copy/paste and then modify the code to run the plot (keeping in mind that you will also need to download the data inputs, or create new inputs). Please feel free to upload your own code for plots, keeping in mind the points below:

1.  Each plot should be in its own labelled folder.

2.  Include a readme.md file in each folder with a brief description of the plot and the code.

3.  Include an .R file with the code for the plot, as well as any necessary data files. Everything to create plots should be self-contained in the folder.

4.  Include a .png file of the plot as an example.

5.  Code and data should be organized such that the plot can be reproduced by running the .R file within the folder. See: [tornado_plot_example.R](https://github.com/HERU-modeling/HERU-Plots/tree/main/Tornado%20Plot/tornado_plot_example.R)

6.  Please make sure that your code is as clean as possible, and try to leave descriptive comments around sections that are important for adjustments or modifications.
