# HERU-Plots

[`HERU-Plots`](https://github.com/HERU-modeling/HERU-Plots) provides a single location for accessing example code from a number of unique plots that have been included in prior publications. This repository is intended to be a living resource, and HERU team members are encouraged to contribute their own code for plots that they have created.

# Instructions

Please feel free to upload your own code for plots, keeping in mind the points below:

1.  Each plot should be in its own labelled folder.

2.  Include a README.md file in each folder with a brief description of the plot and the code.

3.  Include an .R file with the code for the plot, as well as any necessary data files. Everything to create plots should be self-contained in the folder.

4.  Include a .png file of the plot as an example.

5.  Code and data should be organized such that the plot can be reproduced by running the .R file. See: [tornado_plot_example.R](https://github.com/HERU-modeling/HERU-Plots/tree/main/Tornado%20Plot/tornado_plot_example.R)
